# Advanced Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard

This project is a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) dashboard developed for security analysis and academic demonstration. It focuses on correlating malicious IP indicators, mapping them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and generating analyst-ready reports.

The project is designed to simulate how threat intelligence is handled in a real Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Features
- Live IP lookup for real-time investigation
- Analysis of previously collected threat intelligence
- Correlation of malicious IP addresses
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
- PDF report generation
- Version-controlled using GitHub

## What the Project Does
- Allows analysts to investigate any IP address live
- Identifies related malicious infrastructure from stored intelligence
- Provides attacker behavior context using MITRE ATT&CK
- Generates reports for documentation and sharing

## Technologies Used
Python  
Kali Linux  
Streamlit  
MITRE ATT&CK  
Git and GitHub  

## How to Run the Project
Activate virtual environment if used:
source venv/bin/activate

Start the dashboard:
cd dashboard
streamlit run app.py

## Usage
Enter an IP address for live lookup.  
Apply filters to analyze correlated threat data.  
View MITRE ATT&CK mappings.  
Export results as a PDF report.
